RACE3,tournament,"Round robin Asynchronous Codex Extravagansa; tortoise players pick two decks and have a game active for both at all times, hare players pick any number of decks; as such, there are no rounds, so the round number for RACE3 indicates which set of posted matches the match is in. Finals appear to have not been played."

In advance, everyone can pick one non-Black spec to replace with Finesse. Matches all posted at once, in three suggested groupings and two matches per grouping for each player. Suggested two-week playtime per grouping."
