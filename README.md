# codexdata

This is a data package for R, containing tournament match results for the game [Codex by Sirlin Games](http://sirlingames.com/codex). There are also some utility functions for standardising deck names, optionally with the use of nicknames for certain decks.

This is primarily for use in my statistical modelling project [here](https://markwebsterstats.netlify.app/project/codex/), so I reserve the right to change the format of the data at any time. The raw data has a more stable format, and can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lMTR9hYlfLQCQwWA4B4c4a4xcyDRS-CeavLs48Q2mJI/edit#gid=0).
